# OpenMania
This is a WIP open-source framework for making Sonic fangames, heavily based on Sonic Mania. OpenMania features physics accurate to the title, as well as a few objects needed to construct a basic Sonic level. It's also compatible with Mania mods, and can be used to turn mods into independent fangames.

## Disclaimer
This is a non-profit fan project. It is in no way affliated with SEGA or the developers of Sonic Mania. Please buy Sonic Mania with money.

## Documentation
lol

## Bugs
Many at the moment. Missing backgrounds on Android, animation issues, you name it.

## Basic Usage
This project uses my [Hatch Game Engine](https://github.com/aknetk/HatchGameEngine) to power it. You can either build it from source (not updated currently), or use one of the [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/aknetk/OpenMania/releases) on your platform of choice.
(Currently compatible with Windows, MacOS, Nintendo Switch homebrew, Android)

To edit and test the game, place the binary in the same folder as the `Scripts` folder.

Feel free to use this code in other engines or frameworks, this project is for learning purposes, and I would love for it to be used as such.
